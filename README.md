Welcome to the neuron imaging project!
--------------------------------------

The code in this repository was written to identify and track glutamate and 
GABA signaling in neurons.

## Installation

### Required software

This toolbox requires MATLAB R2016b or newer. Additionally, the following 
toolboxes are required (install using Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons):
* Image processing toolbox

The following custom toolboxes are also required (download and install the latest versions):
* [BioFormats Image Toolbox](https://github.com/Biofrontiers-ALMC/bioformats-matlab/releases)
* [Cell Tracking Toolbox](https://github.com/Biofrontiers-ALMC/cell-tracking-toolbox/releases)

### Downloads

1. Once the toolboxes above have been installed, download the contents of this
   repository (Code > Download zip).
2. Extract the files into a directory in your MATLAB path (e.g., in your 
   MATLAB directory)

## Running the code

The following files can be run in MATLAB:
* findCellsinZstack - This script attempts to identify cells in a z-stack file
* trackSpots - This script will identify and track spots in a timelapse file
